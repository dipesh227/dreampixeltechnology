## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dreampixel-ai.git
cd dreampixel-ai
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Environment Variables Setup

This is the most critical step. The application requires API keys and database credentials to function correctly.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open the `.env` file and add your credentials.

```env
# .env

# 1. Default Google Gemini API Key (Required for the 'Default' provider)
# Get your key from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/
VITE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"

# 2. Supabase Database Connection (Required for saving/loading creations)
# Create a project on https://supabase.com/ to get your credentials.
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
```

**Note**: The custom API keys for Gemini, OpenRouter, and OpenAI are managed through the application's "API Settings" modal and stored in your browser's local storage; they are not set in the `.env` file.

### 5. Supabase Database Setup

For the "Liked Creations" and "Feedback" features to work, you need to create two tables in your Supabase project.

1.  Navigate to your project on the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
2.  In the left sidebar, go to the **SQL Editor**.
3.  Click **+ New query**.
4.  Copy and run the following SQL scripts one by one.

**Table 1: `creations`**
```sql
-- Creates the table to store all generated and liked creations.
CREATE TABLE creations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);

-- Add a descriptive comment for clarity within your database schema.
COMMENT ON TABLE creations IS 'Stores liked creations, including the prompt and the resulting image URL.';
```

**Table 2: `feedback`**
```sql
-- Creates the table for user-submitted feedback.
CREATE TABLE feedback (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);

-- Add a descriptive comment.
COMMENT ON TABLE feedback IS 'Collects user feedback submitted through the application''s feedback modal.';
```

Once these tables are created, your application is fully configured to connect to your database.

### 6. Running the Development Server

You are now ready to start the application.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### 7. Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` directory with the static files for deployment.
