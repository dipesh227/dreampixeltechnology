## 2. Phase 1: Foundation & Scaffolding

This phase focused on establishing a robust technical and design foundation.

### 2.1. Technology Stack Selection
- **Frontend Framework:** **React with TypeScript**. Chosen for its component-based architecture which allows for reusable UI elements, strong typing with TypeScript to reduce runtime errors, and a massive ecosystem of libraries.
- **Build Tool:** **Vite**. Selected for its near-instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a superior development experience and its optimized, fast production builds.
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**. Chosen for its utility-first approach, enabling rapid UI development directly in the markup. It ensures design consistency and makes the application's styling highly maintainable and customizable.
- **AI Engine:** **Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)**. Chosen as the exclusive AI provider. This decision was pivotal, as Gemini's advanced multimodal capabilities (understanding and generating both text and images in a single model) are the cornerstone of the application's power. The `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` model, in particular, was identified as critical for image editing and generation tasks.
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** **Supabase**. Selected for its all-in-one solution that combines a PostgreSQL database, secure authentication, and serverless functions. This drastically simplified backend development, allowing the focus to remain on the frontend user experience.

### 2.2. Project Setup
1.  Initialized a new project using the `npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts` command.
2.  Installed core dependencies: `react`, `react-dom`, `@google/genai`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `react-icons`, and `tailwindcss`.
3.  Configured `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` to integrate Tailwind CSS with the project.
4.  Established the initial file structure, separating logic into `components/`, `services/`, `context/`, and `hooks/` directories for maintainability.

### 2.3. UI/UX Design Philosophy
A "futuristic neon" aesthetic was chosen to reflect the cutting-edge AI technology at the core of the app.
- **Theme:** A dark mode-first design to reduce eye strain and make visual content pop.
- **Color Palette:** A base of deep slates (`#030712`, `#111827`) was contrasted with vibrant, glowing gradients (`purple-pink-yellow`) for interactive elements, buttons, and highlights.
- **Typography:** The 'Inter' font was selected for its clean, modern look and excellent readability across all screen sizes.
- **Interactive Flourishes:** To create a memorable and engaging experience, several custom UI elements were designed:
    - **Neon Mouse Trail:** A custom React component (`MouseTrail.tsx`) that adds a dynamic, glowing trail to the user's cursor.
    - **Animated Background:** A CSS-driven starfield effect that subtly pulses and animates faster during AI generation tasks, providing visual feedback to the user.
    - **Custom CSS Effects:** Extensive use of CSS `filter: drop-shadow()` and transitions to create neon glows and smooth hover effects on icons and buttons.

## 3. Phase 2: Core Architecture & Services

This phase focused on building the non-visual backbone of the application.

### 3.1. AI Service Layer (`services/aiService.ts`)
- **Abstraction:** All interactions with the Gemini API were abstracted into a dedicated service layer. This keeps the UI components clean and separates API logic from presentation.
- **API Key Management:** A critical security decision was made to **exclusively** use an environment variable (`process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`) for the API key. This prevents the key from being exposed in the client-side code. An `apiConfigService.ts` was created to handle this logic, and an API status check was implemented in `App.tsx` to provide immediate feedback in the UI if the key is missing or invalid.
- **Error Handling & Retries:** A robust `handleGeminiError` function was created to interpret specific API errors (invalid key, rate limits, safety blocks, network issues) and translate them into user-friendly messages. A `withRetries` wrapper was implemented to automatically retry API calls that fail due to rate limiting, improving application resilience.

### 3.2. Supabase & Database Integration
- **Client Setup (`services/supabaseClient.ts`):** The Supabase client was initialized. For development ease, the URL and anon key were initially hardcoded, with the understanding that they would be moved to environment variables for production.
- **Database Schema:** The entire database schema was designed and written as a single SQL script (now documented in `README.md`). This script sets up tables, enables the `pgsodium` extension for encryption, creates security policies, and defines server-side RPC functions.
- **Connection Status:** A `checkDatabaseConnection` function was implemented to perform a lightweight query, allowing the UI to display a live "green/red dot" status of the database connection in the footer.

### 3.3. Authentication (`context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- A React Context was created to provide global access to the user's authentication state.
- **Google OAuth** was implemented as the sole authentication provider for its security and ease of use.
- The context handles the user's session, profile data (fetched from the `profiles` table), and the state of login/logout processes.

## 4. Phase 3: Feature Implementation - The AI Tools

This was the largest phase, focused on building the core user-facing tools. A standardized pattern was developed to ensure a consistent user experience across the entire suite.

### 4.1. The Reusable Tool Pattern
Each generator tool (e.g., `ThumbnailGenerator.tsx`, `PoliticiansPosterMaker.tsx`) follows a consistent multi-step workflow managed by a React state machine:
1.  **`input` Step:** A comprehensive form where the user provides all necessary inputs (images, text, style selections). Heavy use of tooltips to guide the user.
2.  **`promptSelection` Step:** After submitting inputs, the app calls the AI to generate 3 distinct creative concepts. These are presented to the user in cards, with one marked as "Recommended".
3.  **`generating` Step:** A loading screen with dynamic, reassuring messages that gives the user feedback while the AI generates the final image.
4.  **`result` Step:** The final generated image is displayed with options to Download, Regenerate, or "Like & Save" to their history.

### 4.2. The Art of the Meta-Prompt
The "secret sauce" of DreamPixel lies in its expertly crafted **meta-prompts**. Instead of just passing user input to the AI, the `aiService.ts` constructs a detailed, role-playing prompt that instructs Gemini to act as an expert in a specific field (e.g., "world-class viral content strategist," "award-winning Creative Director").

- **For Concept Generation:** The meta-prompt commands the AI to return its response in a strict JSON format with a defined schema (`CONCEPTS_SCHEMA`). This ensures the data is predictable and easy to parse.
- **For Image Generation:** A second meta-prompt is constructed, combining the user's chosen concept with a **"NON-NEGOTIABLE CORE DIRECTIVE"**. This directive is a highly detailed, emphatic instruction for achieving 1000% photorealistic facial likeness to any uploaded headshotsâ€”a critical and defining feature of the app.

### 4.3. Tool Implementation Highlights
- **Thumbnail & Poster Makers:** These were the flagship tools, establishing the pattern of using one AI call for creative concepts and a second, multimodal call (text prompt + images) for the final generation.
- **Image Enhancer:** A simpler tool that uses a single, powerful prompt instructing the AI to act as a "photo remastering expert," dramatically upscaling and improving image quality. Features a "before/after" comparison slider for a great UX.
- **Headshot Maker:** A more complex, multi-stage tool. It first calls the enhancement service on the user's photo, then makes five parallel calls to the image generation service with prompts modified to request different angles (Front, Left, Right, etc.).
- **Passport Photo Maker:** A hybrid tool combining AI and client-side processing. The AI handles background removal and outfit changes. Then, a client-side `createPrintSheet` function uses an HTML `<canvas>` to arrange the generated photos onto a standard 4x6 print-ready sheet.
- **Visiting Card & Event Poster Makers:** These tools focus on the AI's ability to integrate text stylishly onto an image or design, showcasing its typographic and compositional skills.

## 5. Phase 4: Security & Data Privacy

Security was a top priority from the outset.

### 5.1. Row Level Security (RLS)
- Every table in the Supabase database that contains user data has RLS enabled.
- The primary policy enforced is `auth.uid() = user_id`, which is a database-level rule ensuring that users can **only** ever view or modify their own data.

### 5.2. Server-Side Encryption (`pgsodium`)
- A critical security measure was implemented to protect user privacy. Sensitive text fields, such as the content of "Liked Creations" and "Feedback" submissions, are **encrypted at rest** in the database.
- **Implementation:**
    1. The `pgsodium` extension was enabled in Supabase.
    2. A secure encryption key was generated and stored on the server. This key is **never** exposed to the client.
    3. Instead of writing directly to tables, the application calls PostgreSQL **RPC (Remote Procedure Call) functions** (e.g., `create_encrypted_creation`, `get_decrypted_creations`).
    4. These server-side functions handle the encryption and decryption of data. This is the most secure method, as the unencrypted data is never in transit and the client has no knowledge of the encryption key.

### 5.3. Job Logging
- For analytics and potential debugging, a series of `*_jobs` tables were created.
- These tables log the non-sensitive *inputs* a user provides when starting a generation task. This data is anonymized where possible and helps in understanding which features are most popular and in identifying patterns that may lead to errors.
- These tables are also protected by RLS policies.
